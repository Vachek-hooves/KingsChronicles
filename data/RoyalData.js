    about:
      'Henry VIII (1491–1547) is remembered as the king who reshaped the religious and political landscape of England. Famous for his six marriages, his reign was defined by his desperate quest for a male heir. When the Pope refused to annul his first marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Henry broke with the Catholic Church, creating the Church of England and declaring himself its head. This act initiated the English Reformation. His marriage to Anne Boleyn, who failed to produce a male heir, ended with her execution on charges of adultery and treason—allegations widely believed to have been fabricated. Despite his personal controversies, Henry VIII modernized the English navy and centralized royal authority, leaving a complex legacy as both a tyrant and a reformer.',
